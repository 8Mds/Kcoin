K coin is a decentralized cryptocurrency inspired by the core design concept of Bitcoin. Its characteristics include:

Constant total quantity: Similar to Bitcoin, K coin sets an issuance limit through algorithms (such as 21 million coins) to ensure scarcity and anti inflation properties.

Blockchain technology: Based on distributed ledger to record transactions, data is publicly transparent and tamper proof, and all nodes jointly verify the authenticity of transactions.

Decentralized network: Without central institutional control, users conduct direct transactions through peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, and assets are autonomously managed by private keys.

Mining mechanism: Using Proof of Work (PoW) or other consensus algorithms (such as PoS) to generate new coins and maintain network security, miners receive rewards by contributing computing power.

Anonymity and Security: Transaction addresses are anonymized to protect user privacy through encryption technology, while also resisting risks such as double spending attacks.

Core purpose:

As a store of value or investment target, similar to 'digital gold'.

Support low-cost and efficient transaction scenarios such as cross-border payments and small transfers.
